# BoxMux Development Roadmap

## Project Vision

**Create a declarative, accessible framework that makes building rich terminal interfaces as simple as writing configuration files.**

### Core Objectives
- **Accessibility**: Make TUI development accessible to non-programmers
- **Performance**: Maintain high performance even with complex interfaces  
- **Flexibility**: Support diverse use cases from system monitoring to development tools

## Current Status: v0.76.71205 (Production Ready)

BoxMux is a mature terminal UI framework with 79 implemented features (92% complete).

### âœ… Completed Core Features
- **YAML Configuration System** - Declarative interface definition with JSON schema validation
- **Multi-threaded Architecture** - Responsive UI with separate rendering/input threads
- **Socket-based API** - External control via Unix domain sockets
- **Rich Component Library** - MuxBoxes, menus, charts, tables, real-time updates
- **Auto-Scroll Output** - Auto-scroll for command output with scroll-to-bottom
- **Data Visualization** - Charts and tables with sorting, filtering, pagination
- **Plugin System** - Dynamic component loading with security validation
- **Cross-platform Support** - Verified on macOS, Linux, Unix systems
- **Performance Optimization** - Sub-millisecond input handling, efficient rendering

### Recently Completed Features
- **Auto-Scroll to Bottom**: MuxBoxes automatically scroll to show latest content for logs and command output  
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Table system with CSV/JSON parsing, sorting, filtering, pagination
- **Chart Layout Improvements**: Smart chart layout engine with responsive sizing
- **Plugin System**: Dynamic component loading with security validation
- **Clipboard Integration**: Ctrl+C copies focused box content to clipboard
- **Configuration Schema Validation**: JSON Schema validation for YAML configurations
