# BoxMux Development Roadmap

## Project Vision

**Create a declarative, accessible framework that makes building rich terminal interfaces as simple as writing configuration files.**

### Core Objectives
- **Accessibility**: Make TUI development accessible to non-programmers
- **Performance**: Maintain high performance even with complex interfaces  
- **Flexibility**: Support diverse use cases from system monitoring to development tools

## Current Status: v0.76.71205 (Production Ready)

### âœ… Completed Core Features
- **YAML Configuration System** - Complete declarative interface definition
- **Multi-threaded Architecture** - Responsive UI with separate rendering/input threads
- **Socket-based API** - External control via Unix domain sockets
- **Rich Component Library** - Panels, menus, charts, real-time updates
- **Cross-platform Support** - Verified on macOS, Linux, Unix systems
- **Performance Optimization** - Sub-millisecond input handling, efficient rendering
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - User guides, API reference, examples

### Recent Achievements (v0.76)
- âœ… Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities
- âœ… Crossterm migration for improved cross-platform compatibility
- âœ… Security updates for all dependencies
- âœ… Test coverage improvements (90%+)
- âœ… Critical rendering bug fixes
