            1. Static content (top-left): Should show both vertical and horizontal scrollbars
            2. Script output (top-right): Should show scrollbars and respond to mouse clicks
            3. Many choices (bottom-left): Should show vertical scrollbar for choices
            
            Test:
            - Click on scrollbars to jump to position
            - Use arrow keys to scroll when box is selected
            - Horizontal scrollbars should appear ABOVE bottom border
            - All scrollbars should respond to interaction
