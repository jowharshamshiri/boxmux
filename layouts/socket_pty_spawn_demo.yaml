            Socket PTY Spawn Demo - F0136 Implementation

            Use these CLI commands to spawn PTY processes remotely:

            # Basic PTY spawn with simple script
            boxmux spawn_pty_process pty_demo_box '["echo Hello PTY", "date", "sleep 2", "echo Done"]'

            # PTY spawn with library sourcing
            boxmux spawn_pty_process pty_demo_box '["echo Using libs"]' --libs '["/usr/local/lib/utils.sh"]'

            # PTY spawn with output redirection
            boxmux spawn_pty_process source_box '["echo Redirected output"]' --redirect-output output_box

            # Query PTY status after spawning
            boxmux query_pty_status pty_demo_box

            # Kill PTY process when needed
            boxmux kill_pty_process pty_demo_box
