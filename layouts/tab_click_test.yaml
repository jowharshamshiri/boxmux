            Tab Click Test:
            1. Box 1 (red, z=1) and Box 2 (green, z=10) overlap
            2. Click tabs on overlapping area - should affect Box 2 (higher z-index)
            3. Click tabs on non-overlapping areas - should affect correct box
            4. Each box should have Content, Choices, and additional tabs from choices
