            This panel extends to 100% width.
            Try clicking and dragging at the bottom-right corner to resize.
            The resize corner should be clickable at the rightmost edge.
            
            If the resize doesn't work, the issue is in the mouse event handling,
            not the coordinate detection (which tests confirm works correctly).

        - id: 'normal_panel'
          title: 'Normal Panel (for comparison)'
          position: {x1: 10%, y1: 70%, x2: 90%, y2: 90%}

          fg_color: 'yellow'
          content: |
            This panel should resize normally at the bottom-right corner.
            Use this to compare resize behavior.
